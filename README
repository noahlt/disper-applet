disper-applet.py - an App Indicator (for GNOME and KDE) that acts as
a GUI front-end to Willem van Engen's Disper, which can be found at
<http://willem.engen.nl/projects/disper/>.

To use disper-applet.py, first install Disper from the above URL.
Then run install.sh, which should have come in the same directory as
this file.  Note that this installer will not copy disper-applet.py
anywhere, it simply adds disper-applet.py (wherever it currently
lives) to GNOME's startup programs.
